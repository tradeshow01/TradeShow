                    <p class="iq-mt-25">One of the first things you must learn about the forex market is that although it is enjoyable and exciting, there is no magic button that will instantly turn your pennies into millions of dollars.

                    </p>
                    <p class="iq-mt-25">Forex is by far the largest financial market in the world, with over $6 trillion traded daily globally. That staggering figure, coupled with the magic of leverage, always means that there is immense opportunity to make profits in the Forex market, even though this comes with a lot of risks as well. Technology has literally democratised the Forex market, and there are almost no barriers to entry in the retail scene. Forex trading requires a great deal of knowledge, skill and experience; but because anyone can start trading in an instant, vulnerable people are attracted to the opportunity without due consideration to the inherent risk. Because Forex is a massive goldmine, unethical businesses attempt to attract unsuspecting customers with promises of making big money round the clock.</p>
